This repository contains all scripts used for the different reconstructions.
- Surgele LFM.ipynb is the main Jupyter Notebook
- stack_display.py contains a functions that displays any stack with a possibility to navigate through perspectives or volumes
- fouriersclice_refocusing.py contains the functions adapted from Matlab for the Fourier refocusing
- new_hilo1.py contains the functions adapted from Matlab to perform HiLo reconstruction
- the refocusing.ipynb notebook has been used to test the experimental values and validate the fourierslce algorithm
- the computation_time.ipynb notebook has been used to calculate the computation times for every step of the LFM and HiLo reconstructions
