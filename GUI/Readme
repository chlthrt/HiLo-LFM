This repository contains the different classes needed to generate the main interface.
- main.py is the one to run
- gui.py contains the design functions and links between objects
- all classes define the objects
- pycobolt contains laser functions
- dlpc350 contains functions for the DMD

You may need to add in the same repository the files new_hilo1.py and fourierslice_refocusing.py to make the reconstructions work.
