# Multi-Illumination Light Field Microscopy â€“ Internship Code Repository

This repository contains the code developed during my engineering M2 internship. The project focused on enhancing optical sectioning in **Light Field Microscopy (LFM)** using structured multi-illumination techniques such as **HiLo Microscopy**.

The implementation includes both **manual reconstruction scripts** and the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** files for easier visualization and parameter control.

To use HiLo-LFM reconstruction method (Surgele LFM.ipyn), several Tifffile LF images are needed:
- a reference image,
- a background image,
- a uniform image,
- a directory with at least one structured image for HiLo.
