# Multi-Illumination Light Field Microscopy â€“ Internship Code Repository

This repository contains the code developed during my engineering M2 internship. The project focused on enhancing optical sectioning in **Light Field Microscopy (LFM)** using structured multi-illumination techniques such as **HiLo Microscopy**.

The implementation includes both **manual reconstruction scripts** and the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** files for easier visualization and parameter control.

Please read the Readme files in each repository for further information.
